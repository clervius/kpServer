      <br /><br />
      Feel free to add the books you've read and the topics they've helped you learn. This is all that's needed for Keen Pages to work.
      <br/><br />
      If there are no books for a topic you'd like to learn, feel free to ask a question. The site's users will then suggest a book that covers that topic.
      <br /><br />
      BTW, that's you too. You are now a site user, with the special privilege of suggesting books you've read to others looking to learn the topics you have.
